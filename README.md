BVList.v is a Coq library for dependently typed bitvectors. It consists of a raw bit-vector type representing simply-typed bit-vectors, and a dependently-typed bit-vector type that is generated by instantiating a functor (also defined in the library) with the raw bit-vector module.

InvCond.v consists of the proof statements of 36 invertibility equivalences along with the proof of 13 of them (plus 1 in one direction) - all over raw bitvectors.

DepInvCond.v consists of the proofs of the 13 equivalences and the 1 implication over dependently-typed bit-vectors. 

Many of the proofs in `BVList.v` and `InvCond.v` benefit from the
recostruction tactics of the [Coqhammer](https://github.com/lukaszcz/coqhammer) tool.
However, one does not need to install Coqhammer to be able to compile the library,
since all such tactics are in `Reconstr.v`.

To make:
1. `coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o Makefile`
2. `make`
